# See it in action

 * [Candombed - humble attempt to build a TypeScript Project Editor](https://cancerberosgx.github.io/typescript-in-the-browser/candombed)

# Objectives

Built on top of monaco-typescript-project-util to bring an opinionated TypeScript project editor, very simple to install, 100% browser side as static pages

# Usage

TODO


## Development

```sh
npm install
```

Development environment: 

```sh
npm run dev-prepare # just once
npm run dev # http://localhost:3000/
```

or for candombed: 

```sh
npm run dev-candombed-prepare # just once
npm run dev-candombed # http://localhost:3000/candombed/
```

Production build: 
```sh
npm run all
```

That last one will generate a production ready distribution in ./docs
